    "text": "The building blocks of bioinformatics\nIn my bioinformatics work I take a flexible approach to elucidate biological systems. I design dynamic analytic pipelines to fit the appropriate research questions while maintaining fundamental programmatic building blocks across all projects. To then convey the results of such complex biological interactions it is necessary to have good communications among all members of the research team. An essential component of my role is to train and teach these analytic building blocks and present research outputs visually and interactively.\nI approach teaching with the same concepts. I ran a bioinformatics help session at the Department of Anatomy at the University of Otago, New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) clustering\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 1: Basic processes of bioinformatics"

This program creates and curates reference databases from downloaded sequence data, including NCBI, EMBL, and curated databases such as UNITE. The reference databases from Crabs can be used to prepare reference databases for amplicon sequencing work. It features both insilico PCR and alignment-based methods to find target sequences in online databases. There are also some summary figures that can be generated to evaluate diversity of targets and primers. I also created a Docker image for this program (quay.io/swordfish/crabs).\n\n\n\ndiversity figure from Crabs"

A database included in the package contains all NEON metagenome samples that have been analyzed through the JGI pipeline with extensive metadata to assist in searching. I have written functions that help users search this database and access taxonomic and functional genomic data for each sample.\nFor the processed amplicon sequence data (see analyses), phyloNEON also includes functions to convert downloaded NEON metabarcoding data to the phyloseq package format.\nThis package is being continually developed, with plans to include tools to help researchers access and utilize all NEON genetic data. For some tools they have utility for non-NEON genetic data.\n\n\n\nNEON sample on JGI portal"
